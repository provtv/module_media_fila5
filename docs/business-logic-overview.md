# Media Module - Business Logic Overview

## Core Business Logic Components

### 1. Healthcare Media Management Architecture
The Media module implements comprehensive file and media management for healthcare applications, handling patient documents, medical images, reports, and multimedia content with strict security and compliance requirements.

#### Key Models

- **Media**: Core media file management with metadata and versioning
- **MediaCollection**: Organized collections of related media files
- **MediaConversion**: Image and document format conversions
- **MediaLibrary**: Centralized media library with categorization
- **PatientDocument**: Patient-specific document management with privacy controls

#### Business Rules

- All patient media requires encryption at rest and in transit
- Medical images must maintain DICOM compliance where applicable
- Document retention follows healthcare regulatory requirements
- Access controls based on user roles and patient relationships
- Audit trail required for all media access and modifications

### 2. Patient Document Management

#### Core Functionality
```php
// Store patient document with privacy controls
$patientDocument = PatientDocument::create([
    'patient_id' => $patient->id,
    'document_type' => 'medical_report',
    'file_path' => $encryptedPath,
    'access_level' => 'restricted',
    'retention_period' => '7_years'
]);

// Secure document retrieval with access validation
$document = PatientDocument::getSecureDocument(
    $documentId,
    $currentUser,
    ['verify_patient_relationship' => true]
);
```

#### Business Constraints

- Patient documents require explicit consent for access
- Medical staff can only access documents for their patients
- Document sharing requires audit trail and patient notification
- Sensitive documents have automatic expiration dates
- Emergency access protocols override normal restrictions

### 3. Medical Image Processing

#### Image Workflow

- **Upload Validation**: File type, size, and format verification
- **Security Scanning**: Malware and content validation
- **Format Conversion**: Standardization to approved formats
- **Metadata Extraction**: EXIF data and medical information
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Preview images for quick access
- **Compression**: Optimized storage without quality loss

#### Business Benefits

- Reduced storage costs through intelligent compression
- Faster image loading and preview generation
- Standardized formats for cross-system compatibility
- Enhanced security through format validation
- Automated backup and redundancy management

### 4. Compliance and Security

#### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for all stored media
- **Access Logging**: Complete audit trail of file access
- **Secure Transmission**: TLS encryption for all transfers
- **Data Masking**: Automatic redaction of sensitive information
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with key rotation

#### Business Rules

- All media access requires authentication and authorization
- Patient consent required for document sharing
- Automatic deletion of expired documents
- Regular security audits and compliance checks
- Incident response procedures for data breaches

## Testing Strategy

### Business Logic Tests Required

#### Media Management Tests

- File upload and validation processes
- Security scanning and threat detection

- Access control based on user roles
- Patient relationship verification
- Audit trail generation and accuracy
- Document retention and expiration

#### Image Processing Tests

- Image format conversion quality
- Thumbnail generation accuracy
- Compression without quality loss
- DICOM compliance for medical images
- Batch processing performance

#### Integration Tests

- Healthcare system integration
- Electronic Health Record (EHR) connectivity
- Third-party imaging system compatibility
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Performance under high load
