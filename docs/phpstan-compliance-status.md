# PHPStan Level 10 Compliance Status


**Status**: ✅ FULLY COMPLIANT (0 errors)

## Summary
The Media module was already compliant with PHPStan Level 10 analysis. No errors were found during the verification process, demonstrating excellent type safety and code quality standards.

## Compliance Verification
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse Modules/Media --level=10 --memory-limit=-1
# Result: [OK] No errors
```

## Module Overview

The Media module provides:
- Media file management
- Image processing and manipulation
- File upload handling
- Media library integration
- Media conversion and optimization
- Cloud storage integration

## Best Practices Already Implemented

1. **Type Safety**: All methods have proper type hints
2. **PHPDoc Compliance**: Accurate documentation for complex types
3. **File Handling**: Safe file operations with proper validation
4. **Media Processing**: Type-safe media transformations
5. **Storage Integration**: Clean implementation of storage abstractions

## Media Processing Patterns

The module follows strict patterns for media handling:
- File type validation
- Size and format checking
- Secure file storage
- Optimized media delivery
- Metadata management

## Ongoing Maintenance

To maintain PHPStan compliance:
1. Continue following established type safety patterns
2. Test all media upload/processing features
3. Verify storage integrations work correctly
4. Run PHPStan before committing changes
5. Ensure all new media features maintain type safety
