# Model/Factory/Seeder Audit

Generated: [DATE] 16:29

## Coverage
| Model | Factory | Seeded |
|---|---|---|
| Media | yes | no |
| MediaConvert | yes | no |
| TemporaryUpload | yes | no |

Seeder: `database/seeders/MediaDatabaseSeeder.php`

## Missing / Actions
- Add exemplar seeding for Media, TemporaryUpload (small count) in `MediaDatabaseSeeder` or dedicated seeders.

## Likely non-business-critical
- None; all three are concrete but can be optionally seeded for demos/tests.
